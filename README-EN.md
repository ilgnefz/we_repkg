## Quick Start

The software will automatically detect and recognize wallpapers downloaded by Wallpaper Engine. You can also manually modify the wallpaper path in the settings if needed.
When the software is launched for the first time, it will automatically hide web-based and application-type wallpapers. You can manually enable their display in the settings:

As an auxiliary tool for Wallpaper Engine, its operation logic is designed to be consistent with Wallpaper Engine for a seamless experience.
You can click on a specific wallpaper to perform individual operations:

The right-side menu may vary slightly depending on the wallpaper type. For example, video wallpapers allow you to play the video directly using your system's default media player:
